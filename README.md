# AI Blocker

## Overview

AI Blocker is a Chrome Extension that blocks/hides the typical AI overview that users get when making any google search. By hiding this LLM snippet, this extension aims to greatly improve user's quality of life when making searches and speeds up their workflow by removing an unnecessary feature that typically gets in the way or can provide misinformation.

This extension also has features which redirect users away from any of the most popular generative AI tools and websites, including ChatGPT and DALL-E in order to spread information about the dangers and issues with AI while helping people break a reliance on these tools.
